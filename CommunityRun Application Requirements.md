# CommunityRun Application Requirements
*Firebase Implementation Specification*

## General Overview
CommunityRun is a cross-platform mobile application that connects local runners by enabling them to create, discover, and join running activities in their area. The platform facilitates community building through location-based run sharing while prioritizing user safety and privacy.

### Core User Stories
- **Run Creators**: Users can publish runs with details (time, location, pace, distance) and manage participants
- **Run Discoverers**: Users can browse nearby runs, filter by preferences, and join activities that match their schedule and ability
- **Community Members**: Users can build connections through shared running experiences and maintain run history

---

## Technical Architecture

### Platform Choice
- **Primary Platform**: Flutter for cross-platform development (iOS and Android)
- **Backend Service**: Firebase Suite (Google Cloud)
- **State Management**: Provider or Riverpod for Flutter app state
- **Target Deployment**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store

### Firebase Services Integration

## Firebase Security and Implementation Details

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Users can read and write their own profile
    match /userProfiles/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Anyone can read runs, but only creators can modify their runs
    match /runs/{runId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId
        && request.time < resource.data.dateTime;
      
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
        && (request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId
            || 'participants' in getAfterData().diff(resource.data).affectedKeys());
      
      allow delete: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId;
    }
    
    // Messages can be read by run participants, written by authenticated users
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/runs/$(resource.data.runId)).data.participants;
      
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.senderId;
    }
    
    // Block and report collections (user-specific)
    match /userBlocks/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firebase Cloud Functions (TypeScript/Node.js)

#### Automatic Data Cleanup
```typescript
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';

// Clean up old runs (90 days after completion)
export const cleanupOldRuns = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('0 2 * * *') // Daily at 2 AM
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    const cutoffDate = new Date();
    cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - 90);
    
    const oldRuns = await admin.firestore()
      .collection('runs')
      .where('dateTime', '<', cutoffDate)
      .get();
    
    const batch = admin.firestore().batch();
    oldRuns.docs.forEach(doc => batch.delete(doc.ref));
    
    return batch.commit();
  });
```

#### Push Notification Triggers
```typescript
// Send notification when someone joins a run
export const onRunJoined = functions.firestore
  .document('runs/{runId}')
  .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
    const before = change.before.data();
    const after = change.after.data();
    
    if (after.participants.length > before.participants.length) {
      const newParticipant = after.participants.find(
        p => !before.participants.includes(p)
      );
      
      // Send notification to run creator
      await admin.messaging().send({
        token: await getUserFCMToken(before.creatorId),
        notification: {
          title: 'New Runner Joined!',
          body: `Someone joined your run: ${after.title}`
        },
        data: { runId: context.params.runId }
      });
    }
  });
```

### Real-time Data Synchronization

#### Location-based Run Queries (Flutter)
```dart
import 'package:geoflutterfire2/geoflutterfire2.dart';

class RunService {
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  final GeoFlutterFire _geo = GeoFlutterFire();
  
  Stream<List<Run>> getNearbyRuns({
    required double latitude,
    required double longitude,
    required double radiusInKm,
  }) {
    GeoFirePoint center = _geo.point(
      latitude: latitude, 
      longitude: longitude
    );
    
    return _geo
      .collection(collectionRef: _firestore.collection('runs'))
      .within(
        center: center,
        radius: radiusInKm,
        field: 'startLocation',
      )
      .map((docs) => docs.map((doc) => Run.fromFirestore(doc)).toList());
  }
  
  Future<void> joinRun(String runId, String userId) async {
    await _firestore.collection('runs').doc(runId).update({
      'participants': FieldValue.arrayUnion([userId]),
      'currentParticipants': FieldValue.increment(1),
    });
  }
}
```

#### Real-time UI Updates
```dart
class RunListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<List<Run>>(
      stream: context.read<RunService>().getNearbyRuns(
        latitude: userLocation.latitude,
        longitude: userLocation.longitude,
        radiusInKm: selectedRadius,
      ),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.hasData) {
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: snapshot.data!.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              return RunCard(run: snapshot.data![index]);
            },
          );
        }
        return const CircularProgressIndicator();
      },
    );
  }
}
```
